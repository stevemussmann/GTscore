#Demultiplex.pl
#
#Input:
#	Input consists of two files. The first file contains barcodes and sample IDs, 
#	the second file contains the raw sequence data.
#
#Usage:
#	perl Demultiplex.pl -b barcodeFile.txt -s sequencefile.fastq
#
#Input File Formats:	
#	Barcode file should include each dual index barcode and sample ID in a separate line
#	The sample name is in the first column, the i7 barcode in the second column, and the i5 barcode in the third column
#	samples can be named whatever you like as long as there are no spaces in the sample name
#
#		ex. sample1	ATCACGAT	AAACGGTC
#			sample2	ATCACGAT	ACTCTTTC
#			sample3	ATCACGAT	ATTCCGTC
#
#	Sequence file should be a standard fastq format which consist of lines in 
#	repeating blocks of four.  
#		The first line includes ID information
#		The second line includes sequence information
#			(this is where barcodes are matched)
#		The third line contains more ID information?
#		The fourth line contains the quality score
#
#Output file Format:
#	A file containing demultiplexed sequences in fastq format is automatically
#	output for each sample using the sample names specified in the barcode file
